The R-matrix method, introduced by Wigner and Eisenbud, has been applied to a broad range of electron transport problems in nanoscale quantum devices. With the rapid increase in the development and modelling of nanodevices, efficient, accurate, and general computation of Wigner-Eisenbud functions is required. This paper presents the Mathematica package WignerEisenbud, which uses the Fourier discrete cosine transform to compute the Wigner-Eisenbud functions in dimensionless units for an arbitrary potential in one dimension, and two dimensions in cylindrical coordinates.
